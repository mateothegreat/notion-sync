# Solution Architectures

This document outlines different solution architectures for the `notion-exporter` to address different scale scenarios.

## Small Workspace

* **Architecture:** Monolithic application with in-memory message queue.
* **Description:** A single process handles all tasks, with an in-memory message queue for decoupling.
* **Infrastructure:** Single server or container.
* **Cost:** Low.
* **Performance:** Suitable for small workspaces with a limited number of pages and blocks.
* **Trade-offs:** Limited scalability and resilience.
* **Implementation Timeline:** 1-2 weeks.
* **Resource Requirements:** 1-2 developers.

## Medium Workspace

* **Architecture:** Microservices with a dedicated message queue.
* **Description:** Separate microservices for each main task (e.g., page export, block export), communicating via a dedicated message queue such as RabbitMQ.
* **Infrastructure:** Multiple servers or containers, message queue server.
* **Cost:** Medium.
* **Performance:** Suitable for medium-sized workspaces with a moderate number of pages and blocks.
* **Trade-offs:** Increased complexity, but better scalability and resilience.
* **Implementation Timeline:** 2-4 weeks.
* **Resource Requirements:** 2-3 developers.

## Enterprise Workspace

* **Architecture:** Microservices with a distributed message queue and autoscaling.
* **Description:** Separate microservices for each main task, communicating via a distributed message queue such as Kafka. Autoscaling is used to automatically scale the number of worker instances based on demand.
* **Infrastructure:** Multiple servers or containers, distributed message queue cluster, autoscaling infrastructure.
* **Cost:** High.
* **Performance:** Suitable for large workspaces with a large number of pages and blocks.
* **Trade-offs:** High complexity, but excellent scalability and resilience.
* **Implementation Timeline:** 4-8 weeks.
* **Resource Requirements:** 3-5 developers.

## Infrastructure Requirements

* **Small Workspace:**
  * 1 server or container with 2GB RAM and 1 CPU core.
* **Medium Workspace:**
  * 3 servers or containers with 4GB RAM and 2 CPU cores.
  * 1 message queue server with 2GB RAM and 1 CPU core.
* **Enterprise Workspace:**
  * 5+ servers or containers with 8GB RAM and 4 CPU cores.
  * 3+ node distributed message queue cluster with 4GB RAM and 2 CPU cores per node.
  * Autoscaling infrastructure.

## Cost Projections

* **Small Workspace:** \$50/month
* **Medium Workspace:** \$200/month
* **Enterprise Workspace:** \$500+/month

## Performance Characteristics

* **Small Workspace:** 10 pages/second
* **Medium Workspace:** 50 pages/second
* **Enterprise Workspace:** 100+ pages/second
