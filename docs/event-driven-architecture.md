3. Better Error Handling: Errors are handled consistently with RxJS operators
4. Cancellation Support: Using takeUntil for proper cleanup
5. Concurrency Control: Built-in with RxJS operators like mergeMap


* Fully reactive implementation using Observables
* Real-time progress and status streams
* Proper error handling with RxJS operators
* Caching with BehaviorSubjects for state management
