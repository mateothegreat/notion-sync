# Proposed Outcomes - Notion Sync Production Implementation

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of the Notion Sync codebase, I propose three distinct outcomes for transforming this project into a production-ready, event-driven system capable of exporting entire Notion workspaces at scale efficiently and reliably.

## Current State Analysis Summary

### ✅ Strengths Identified
- **Solid Event-Driven Foundation**: Well-designed domain events, control plane, and message bus
- **Clean Domain Architecture**: Proper aggregates, services, and separation of concerns
- **Infrastructure Components**: Circuit breakers, rate limiting, and basic Notion API integration
- **TypeScript Implementation**: Strong typing and modern development practices

### ❌ Critical Issues Found
- **Dead Code**: Entire `/old/` directory with conflicting implementations
- **Mixed Patterns**: Old streaming manager alongside new event-driven architecture
- **Incomplete Implementation**: Missing file operations, event store, and proper repositories
- **Architecture Violations**: Direct service calls instead of event-driven patterns
- **Production Gaps**: No monitoring, limited testing, in-memory state only

## Proposed Outcomes
